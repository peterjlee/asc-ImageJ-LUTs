# asc-ImageJ-LUTs
<p>Color lookup tables (LUTs) that are friendly to color-blind viewers and that are also easily converted to linear gradients for black and white printing in some journals can be useful. To this end we have modified the new &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU&amp;feature=youtu.be" Title = "Link to a YouTube presentation on the Viridis LUT" >Viridis</a>&quot; LUT so that it has a more linear conversion to gray:</p>
